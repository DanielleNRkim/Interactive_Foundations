		<div class="itemR">Q1. DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND ROLES?</div>
		<div class="itemL">I can only answer this based on my own work and interests. I enjoy our work because it allows me to engage with, interpret, and translate ideas that are critical to what our clients do, which then become central to our design concepts. It's important to me that we approach every project on its own terms, and begin with as few preconceptions as possible. I also enjoy research (particularly into the context around a project), typography, getting to work with a wide variety of people, and working in a range of media. If you're lucky, graphic design affords you the opportunity to learn about a lot of different things.</div>
		<div class="itemL">A graphics designers role is to create visual language that embodies the ethos, tone and personality of a project, while communicating and reaching the audience. It is the designers role to tell a story.</div>



		<div class="itemR"> Q2. DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A GOOD GRAPHIC DESIGNER IS?
		<br> WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE THAT A GRAPHIC DESIGNER MUST HAVE?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> A good graphic designer is perceptive, curious, asks lots of questions, and humble enough to know how much they don't know.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> A good designer creates work that has purpose, reason and depth. There needs to be reason behind design decisions. A good designer thinks and feels to the project to</div>


		<div class="itemR"> Q3. HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOUR GRAPHIC STYLE? OR IS YOUR DESIGN PURSUING A PARTICULAR GRAPHICAL STYLE?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I think about my methods as comprising an approach more than a style. I never begin by thinking, "how can I apply my style to this problem?" By starting this way, you're not doing justice to either the project/content/client or to yourself. I am certainly interested in structures and organizing principles, and how they can be used not only to provide order but also to carry meaning and offer an interpretation of the content. There's always a strong emphasis on typography as both a visual and conceptual element. But it's always been my hope to build a body of work that feels coherent and unified, but not uniform.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I believe there is a style or tone to my work, yet find it hard to define. I think my style would be characterized by color and typography.</div>


		<div class="itemR"> Q4. 

		How do you get inspired for your design? Are there any tactics to visualize in your design?</div>
		<div class="itemL">By not designing. This has been harder than usual during the pandemic, of course—I'm feeling a real lack of input these days. But many of the strongest ideas come when I'm doing something else. Sometimes it's while reading and immersing myself in the material we're working with. But just as often inspiration comes when I'm distracted by something totally unrelated.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I try and always think and feel with my thoughts and see where my mind can take me. I like to start most of my projects by sitting down with a cup of tea and notepad and I'll try and think of as many ideas as possible.  I do also love getting inspiration from images and enjoy scrolling blogs and pinterest to spark ideas.</div>

		<div class="itemR"> Q5. What is your design process when it comes to starting a project? Could you describe your design process?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I think I've answered this already in the question about style above, but I'd add that the process is almost never linear, and that it's important to balance logic with intuition. I tend toward the former, and often have to remind myself of the importance of the latter.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I always start a project by getting a brief and as much info from the client as possible. I like to quiz them on the tone, audience and dos and don'ts. I try and have a strong understanding before I begin a project. 
		Once I've researched and have a strong understanding of the brief I'll try an write down as many ideas as possible and when one sticks I'll start moodboarding. I alway like to present my clients a moodboard so we can create a clear design direction. I alway have a clear direction before I start designing and developing.</div>

		<div class="itemR"> Q6. What is the most important thing or consideration in your design?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> There is no one thing. My answers above should help to convey what's important to me.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> Purpose, story and beauty. </div>



		<div class="itemR"> Q7. When you face difficulty in design, how do you handle it?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> It depends on the kind and degree of difficulty! Usually it involves talking with others facing the same difficulty, as almost nothing we do is truly done alone. Sometimes I step away from the problem, since time and distance can make things seem less difficult.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> It is hard when projects don't feel like they're not coming together and you're feeling like nothing it sticking. And so when this happens I find I need a break and to go back to my initial ideas in my notepad. To remind myself what I'm here to do. </div>




		<div class="itemR"> Q8. When you start to do a self-initiated project, Is there a specific topic you want to discuss?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I don't do self-initiated work. I have plenty of interests and concerns I like to bring to bear in my work, but it's always done in the context of a commission.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I'm passionate about print, there's a self-initiated project I'm currently beginning. I also love developing type so creating typefaces is another. </div>



		<div class="itemR"> Q9. How did you find your graphic style? Could you tell me how you could look for your own style?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> For me, it's always been a matter of being honest with myself about what I'm interested in, and not trying to force a style or approach—when I've tried to do this, it's never ended well, nor has it felt right along the way. Working with clients who have an understanding, appreciation, and respect for our work has also helped in that they're coming to us because they like our approach. This makes it easier to work in a way that feels faithful to my own concerns.</div>
		<div class="itemL"> I think developing a style is fluid and happens naturally with time. I think it's good to start out experimenting and pushing yourself and then you can find what you love creating. </div>



		<div class="itemR"> Q10. For the students who want to work as a freelancer, could you give anything you want to give advice?</div>
		<div class="itemL"> Be eager to learn, curious, self-critical, and willing to work hard!</div>
		<div class="itemL"> Try and get experience in a studio and learn as much as you can. While being a student or while working build your own folio of work and instagram. 
		Share your work and try and put yourself out there and then naturally work may come to you. </div>
